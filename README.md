# protective-ventilation
Calculates suitable tidal volumes for anaesthetised patients based on ideal body weight.

It is recommended that anaesthetised patients should be ventilated at a tidal volume of between 6 and 8 ml/kg based on the ideal body weight. This can be difficult to estimate in clinical practice because people are frequently heavier than their ideal body weight.
The ideal body weight is calculated based on height and gender.
The ideal body weight is used to calculate the recommended tidal volume.
